# Getting Started with Product Review Website

# Content on our product review website: -

* We have a search bar on our website from which we can select a specific product.
* Our products are listed in the form of a card with 3 products in each row.
* Clicking the Buy Now button of any product from the product list will take you to the product_name route, and every product and   details will show up there. There is a section here from which we can review that particular product. And those reviews will show up to his right. After that, the review will remain there until you return from that route and reload the browser.
* This website uses Redux for State Management. And Bootstrap has been used as a CSS and framework.
* I have used fake storage for data.
